        <p>I live in Haacht, near Leuven, Belgium.
            I am currently in my second year of Applied Informatics at UCLL in Leuven. I have chosen to enroll the software development specialization because I've always liked programming and thought I was a good programmer. </p>

        <p>I also have a deep interest in game development. I plan on following a second bachelor for game development in Kortrijk at the DAE, Howest.</p>

        <h3>Network & Systems Intern</h3>

        <p>Royal Atheneum Vilvoorde, January 2017 - February 2017</p>

        <p>In this high school internship I was the network and systems manager for another high school.
            I had to implement a FOG system to remotely & automatically upgrade Windows and install Office 365 on all computers in the network.</p>

        <p>In small, I was also the network and systems manager for times my supervisor wasn't available.
            I had to add new students into the system and make sure they have their own password and privileges on the computers.
        </p>

        <p>Results:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fully automated Windows and Office 365 installation for computers all over the network, with one simple click.</li>
            <li>Deeper understanding of Linux and Windows Servers, specifically group policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Salesman Studentjob</h3>

        <p>Makro Machelen,2015 - 2018</p>

        <p>I was a student job for every weekend at a bakery for four years.</p>

        <h3>Extras</h3>

        <p>At every end of the semester, our school has a project week, with groups of 4-8 students (varying every project).
            Every project, I chose to be the project manager and/or team leader because I thought I was very good at it. My professors complimented me for it.</p>

        <p>I am very motivated to work and can learn really fast. If I don’t understand something,
            I will do everything to understand it and be able to work with it. </p>
